* Basic Idea for Parasite 1.

- [ ] Users connect to a video of the installation running (opentok video)
- [0/1] There is a big div of the video, surround by buttons, which light up the stairs and trigger sounds in the host video.
  - [ ] Either from their stream or a set of pre-recorded sound
- [ ] They watch as users trigger sounds on stairs (cylon js)

* Plan
  - [ ] User Interface [0/2]
    - [ ] Create Two Pages, One for local, one remote.
    - [1/2] Make page which shows opentok video when user connects.
      - [X] Add Users via boxes
      - [ ] Format CSS
    - [ ] Have UI Boxes which reflect hover state or touch
  - [ ] Robot Control
