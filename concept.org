* Basic Idea for Parasite 1.

-  Users connect to a video of the installation running (opentok video)
- There is a big div of the video, overlayed with transparent boxes, (or underneath if media port is higher?) which light up
- They watch as users trigger sounds on stairs (cylon js)
- If video is associated with stair, user audio plays instead.

* Plan
  - [-] User Interface [1/3]
    - [ ] Create Two Pages, One for local, one remote.
    - [X] Make page which shows opentok video when user connects.
      - Format CSS
      - Add Users via boxes
    - [ ] Have UI Boxes which reflect hover state or touch
  - [ ] Robot Control
